AI Tools Assignment: AI Tools and Applications
Theme: "Mastering the AI Toolkit" 🛠️🧠

Objective & Guidelines

This assignment evaluates your understanding of AI tools/frameworks and their real-world applications through a mix of theoretical and practical tasks. You’ll demonstrate proficiency in selecting, implementing, and critically analyzing AI tools to solve problems.

The assignment has three parts: theory, which tests the theoretical understanding of AI Tools; Practical, which tests the implementation skills of AI tools; and Ethics and optimization, which tests ethical AI development and AI software optimization skills. 

The assignment should be handled as group work formed by 3-5 people. This is to enhance teamwork and AI engineering collaboration.

Submission Guidelines

Code: Well-commented scripts/Jupyter notebooks. (To be submitted on GitHub)

Report: A PDF with:

Answers to theoretical questions. 

Screenshots of model outputs (e.g., accuracy graphs, NER results).

Ethical reflection.

(Share this PDF as an article in the Community, Peer Group Review and include it in the GitHub Repo)

Presentation: Create 3-minute video explaining your approach. (All members in the group should participate in the video. Share the video on the Community platform)
